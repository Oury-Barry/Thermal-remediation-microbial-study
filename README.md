# Thermal Remediation and Microbial Community Analysis at a Retired Coal Gas Plant

## Abstract  
Thermal remediation is a common approach to remove organic pollutants from contaminated sites. This study investigates the ecological response and spatial distribution of microorganisms and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a retired coal gas plant site in Nanjing, China, after in situ thermal remediation. Using high-throughput sequencing, we found that soil depth, temperature, and contamination level significantly affected microbial communities. Thermophilic PAH-degrading bacteria were identified, and Firmicutes demonstrated better stress resistance and adaptability to thermal remediation conditions. Key environmental factors influencing microbial distribution included temperature, total nitrogen, oxidation-reduction potential, organic matter, and PAH concentrations. This work improves understanding of microbial resilience and adaptation following thermal remediation.


## Highlights  
- Thermal remediation temperature and soil depth drive bacterial distribution.  
- Firmicutes exhibit strong stress resistance and adaptability.  
- Thermophilic PAH-degrading bacteria identified by soil temperature and depth.  
- Temperature, total nitrogen, ORP, organic matter, and PAHs are key factors affecting bacterial distribution.

## Conclusions  
The microbial composition and functions in soil from the post-thermal remediation site were clearly influenced by soil depth, temperature, and contamination level. 
Aerobic bacteria declined with depth due to oxygen depletion, while thermophilic and PAH-degrading bacteria increased in abundance at certain depths and pollution levels. 
Firmicutes showed positive response to remediation conditions, indicating better adaptability. These findings provide insight into microbial community dynamics in remediated contaminated soils.</div>
